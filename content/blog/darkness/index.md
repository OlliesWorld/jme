Well, aren't you going up to the lake tonight, you've been planning it for two weeks. Uh, you mean nobody's asked you? Hello, hello, anybody home? Think, McFly, think. I gotta have time to get them re-typed. Do you realize what would happen if I hand in my reports in your handwriting. I'll get fired. You wouldn't want that to happen would you? Would you? Yeah well, I saw it on a rerun. My equipment, that reminds me, Marty, you better not hook up to the amplifier. There's a slight possibility for overload.

Yeah, I think maybe you do. Okay, but I don't know what to say. Okay, that's enough. Now stop the microphone. I'm sorry fellas. I'm afraid you're just too darn loud. Next, please. Where's the next group, please. Are those my clocks I hear? Actually, people call me Marty.

This is the final render.
